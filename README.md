## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **src/app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

 ## Scripts

Package manager is pnpm (`packageManager` pinned in package.json — don't use npm/yarn).

- `pnpm start` — start the Metro dev server (Expo Go / dev client)
- `pnpm ios` / `pnpm android` / `pnpm web` — start and open on a specific platform
- `pnpm lint` — runs `expo lint` (ESLint, flat config via `eslint-config-expo/flat`)
- `pnpm reset-project` — moves `src/` and `scripts/` to `example/` (or deletes them) and creates a blank `src/app/` with `index.tsx`/`_layout.tsx`; run only when explicitly asked to strip the template
- `pnpm test` — run the Vitest suite once (`vitest run`)
- `pnpm test:watch` — run Vitest in watch mode

Integration tests (`tests/`) hit a local Supabase instance directly — run `supabase start` first, and fill in `.env.test.local` (see `.env.example`) with the local API URL/anon key from `supabase status`. Tests are type-checked separately from the app via `tsconfig.test.json` (Node-scoped, not the Expo/RN-scoped root `tsconfig.json`) — see `pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit`.

## Architecture
### Backend


### Frontend
- The `expo reset-project` template strip has been run: `src/` currently holds only the blank scaffold (`src/app/_layout.tsx` with a bare `Stack`, `src/app/index.tsx` with a placeholder screen). The tabs/theming/platform-file structure previously documented here no longer exists — rebuild this section once the app is scaffolded back out.
- **Routing**: Expo Router (file-based). Routes live in `src/app/`, not the conventional root-level `app/` — this is set via the `expo-router` plugin/main entry, so don't expect Expo's default docs paths to match without checking `src/app/`.
- Import alias `@/*` → `src/*` and `@/assets/*` → `assets/*` (see `tsconfig.json`). Use these instead of relative `../../` paths.

### Autogen code
These are procedurally generated files.  Never edit them.

### Libraries
- date-fns: preferred as more readable and ergonomic than native Javascript Date objects
